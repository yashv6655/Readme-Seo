## Overview

README Generator is a full-stack web application that scores, improves, and manages README files with AI assistance. Built specifically for Sita's ICP of software engineering teams at mid-to-large tech companies seeking to reduce developer onboarding time and improve codebase accessibility through better documentation.

## Architecture Requirements Addressed

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Extract**: README content and repository context via GitHub API integration
- **Transform**: AI-powered scoring and optimization using Anthropic Claude with structured prompts
- **Load**: Persistent storage in Supabase PostgreSQL with user association and version history

### Full-Stack Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React Server Components, and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with serverless functions for scoring and optimization
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) for user data isolation
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSR/Browser clients and middleware-based route protection

### Internet Deployment Ready
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 optimized for Vercel deployment with edge runtime support
- **Database**: Cloud-hosted Supabase instance with global CDN
- **Environment**: Production-ready with secure environment variable configuration
- **Build**: TypeScript compilation with optimized bundle splitting and caching

### Database Integration
- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with real-time capabilities
- **Schema**: Normalized tables for readmes, templates, and analytics with proper indexing
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies restricting data access to owners only
- **Performance**: Indexed queries on user_id, created_at, and project identifiers

### Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based session management via Supabase Auth
- **Authorization**: User-scoped data access with RLS policies for complete data isolation
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication checks for protected pages
- **API Security**: Server-side environment variable usage for sensitive keys (CLAUDE_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN)
- **Privacy**: Analytics metadata-only tracking without README content exposure to PostHog

### Sita ICP Alignment
**Target Audience**: Engineering managers and senior developers at scaling tech companies with complex codebases

**Core Problem Solved**: 
- New hires take months to become productive in large, poorly-documented codebases
- Developers waste hours daily asking "where is this?" questions and spelunking through code
- Poor documentation creates bottlenecks that slow feature delivery and increase AI token usage from exploratory queries

**Direct Connection to Sita's Mission**:
- **"Reduce onboarding time from months to weeks"**: Clear, current READMEs create the "codebase map" that new developers need to navigate quickly
- **"3 hours saved per week"**: Better documentation reduces interruptions and context-switching for existing team members
- **"Cut AI token spend by 15%"**: Comprehensive READMEs provide better context for AI coding assistants, reducing exploratory queries

**Business Impact**: 
- Faster developer onboarding → increased team productivity → accelerated feature delivery
- Reduced documentation debt → fewer "tribal knowledge" bottlenecks → better team scalability
- Improved codebase accessibility → enhanced developer experience → better talent retention

### Beautiful Design
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with consistent spacing, typography, and responsive layouts
- **Design System**: Clean, focused interface with dark mode support and consistent components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design optimized for desktop development workflows
- **UX**: Intuitive editor flows, real-time preview, and streamlined review processes

### Analytics Enabled
**Platform**: PostHog for comprehensive behavioral analytics and product optimization

**Detailed Event Tracking**:

*README Optimization Funnel*:
- `score_initiated` - User starts README scoring process
- `score_completed` - Scoring analysis finished with performance metrics
- `optimize_started` - User begins README optimization
- `optimize_completed` - Optimization finished with improvement metrics
- `optimized_applied_to_editor` - User applies optimized content to editor

*Content Management*:
- `readme_saved` - User saves README to persistent storage
- `readme_exported` - Export functionality usage for sharing
- `template_applied` - User applies predefined template
- `version_compared` - User compares different README versions

*User Engagement*:
- `$pageview` - Page navigation tracking with custom page names
- `$pageleave` - Session completion and engagement duration
- `feature_discovered` - User interaction with key features
- `github_integration_used` - Repository context fetching usage

## Technology Choices & Reasoning

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15 (App Router)**: Modern full-stack framework with file-based routes and edge-ready APIs
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for large-scale application development and better API contracts
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid, consistent UI development without bespoke design system overhead
- **React Server Components**: Improved performance and SEO with server-side rendering

### Backend & AI
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for scalable backend logic
- **Anthropic Claude**: Advanced language model with superior instruction-following for structured README outputs
- **GitHub API Integration**: Real repository context fetching for grounded AI responses
- **Structured Prompts**: Optimized prompt engineering for consistent, high-quality documentation generation

### Database & Analytics
- **Supabase (Postgres + Auth)**: Fast hosted database with RLS and simple SSR/Client SDKs
- **PostHog**: Product analytics without vendor lock-in and web-first SDK integration
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates for collaborative editing scenarios

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployments with preview environments and global edge caching
- **Edge Runtime**: Optimized performance with reduced cold start times
- **Environment Management**: Secure configuration management across development and production
